# Malaria and  economic development in the short-run: Plasmodium falciparum vs Plasmodium vivax

by Michaela Kecskésová and Štěpán Mikula (stepan.mikula@econ.muni.cz)

Malaria---a disease caused by parasitic microorganisms of the Plasmodium genus---is shown to impede economic growth and socioeconomic development in the long-term. In this paper we use annual regional data from India to show that malaria outbreaks are associated with immediate decline in economic development approximated by night-light intensity. We find the association to be significant for outbreaks of both globally most prevalent Plasmodium species: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The estimated associations are quite sizeable. Occurrence of a strong outbreak is correlated with a decline in night-lights by 5% of its standard deviation for P. falciparum and by 4% for P. vivax.
